# Object-Count-using-YOLOV3

Description:
This code can detect object from image as well as in real time. I have used YoloV3 for object detection and COCo dataset which can identify 80 types of object.



Direction:
1. coco.names, YOLOV3.cfg, YOLOV3.weight file have to be in the same folder
2. Press "q"  in  real time object detection for breaking the loop.
