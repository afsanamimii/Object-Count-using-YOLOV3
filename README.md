# Object-Count-using-YOLOV3

Description:

1.This code can detect object from image as well as in real time. I have used YoloV3 for object detection and COCo dataset which can identify 80 types of object.

2.The yolo3.weights can be find in the followwing link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aQn8Lh1wVhIKMkn0wWxvRt12p1-4EBlO/view?usp=sharing

3.In "object detection count In realtime example.mp4" I have recorded the output of real time object count.

4.In "example1" and "example2" I have showed the output of object count from image


Direction:
1. coco.names, yolov3.cfg, yolo3.weights file have to be in the same folder
2. Press "q"  in  real time object detection for breaking the loop.
